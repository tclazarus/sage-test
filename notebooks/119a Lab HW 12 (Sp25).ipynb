Lactose can diffuse into the cell, but having a channel specifically designed to lead extracellular lactose into the cell would make the process much faster.  The protein *lactose permease* creates a channel to import lactose into the cell.  However, channel proteins like this take a lot of resources to build.  Therefore, E. coli will only build the channels when there is plenty of extracellular lactose around (this is the bacterium \"switching on\" production).  The assumptions we will make for this model are:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Spruce budworms (genus *Choristoneura*) are insects that feed on coniferous trees, such as spruce trees. Their population has a curious behavior: most of the time, the population remains at relatively low, manageable levels. (We will refer to this as the population being in **refuge**.) But sometimes, as a result of particularly good conditions in their environment (i.e., high carrying capacity), there is a sudden and massive growth in the spruce budworm population. (We will refer to this as a population **outbreak**.) The curious part is that, after such an outbreak, even after the environment returns to normal (i.e., after the carrying capacity drops back to its previous level), the spruce budworm population remains high! That is, it remains in outbreak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists have found that what keeps the population in refuge under normal conditions is that they are preyed upon by birds, most notably the Cape May warbler (*Setophaga tigrina*).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model the spruce budworm population using the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $N$ be the spruce budworm population.\n",
    "- In the absence of predation by birds, the population grows logistically, with a natural per-capita growth rate $r$, and a carrying capacity of $k$.\n",
    "- The warbler population remains constant , as they have other food sources.  \n",
    "- The rate of predation by the warblers increases with the budworm population up to a certain level. The warblers can only eat so many worms. We will use the sigmoid function to model this predation: $predation(N) = \\dfrac{N^2}{1+N^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the resulting differential equation is $$N' = r \\cdot N \\cdot \\left( 1- \\dfrac{N}{k}\\right) - \\dfrac{N^2}{1+N^2}$$  In everything below, we will assume that $r$ is constant and we will only vary $k$.  Specifically, we will assume $r=0.55$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.1:**  One equilibrium value is of course $N=0$.  The code below helps us find the remaining equilibrium points where we could use the over-under method to classify them.  Try varying the slider for $k$ to see how the equilibria change.  **There will be a region of values where four equilibria show up.  The question below focuses on this region of values.**\n",
