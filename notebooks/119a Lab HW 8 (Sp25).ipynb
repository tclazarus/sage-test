    "**Question 5.1:**  When working with systems that oscillate like this, it's common for our time series solution to be wave functions \\(called sine and cosine\\), because these functions are periodic in nature. In this context, periodic means a repeating pattern.  There are different characteristics of periodic behavior, including the length of time it takes to repeat the pattern.  Using different values on the slider, determine which initial values of tuna correspond to a longer period of time to return to the same state \\(same values\\).\n",
