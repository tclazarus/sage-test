    "As we saw in class, the exact area under a curve can be hard to calculate, but the approximation of the area using rectangles is pretty straightforward.   In this set of problems, you will explore left and right sum approximations and how those approximations differ from the exact, true area under a curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we know that the notation $\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(t) \\, dt$ means the exact net area underneath the function $f(t)$ from $t=a$ to $t=b$.  Even though the exact area may be hard to find, we could always approximate it using rectangles.  If we divide the interval $[a,b]$ into equally sized pieces of $\\Delta t$, we can use that value as the width.  Using a uniform value for $\\Delta t$ means the rectangles all have a fixed width, and only the height of the rectangle will change base on the function values at different points.  The height of the rectangle comes from the function value at a particular point.  Therefore, if we add up all the areas of the little rectangles, we should get a decent approximation of the area under the curve.  We can then make the approximation better by using more rectangles.\n",

    "In real world calculations, we most often only have discrete data points, not a nice formula for a function.  In the following problems we will use sample data from a commonly used antibiotic and analyze it as a pharmacist would.  Pharmacology is the study of how drugs and the body interact.  Pharmacokinetics is a subfield that studies what the body does to a drug, and pharmacodynamics studies what the drug does to the body.  In this example, we will do a routine pharmacokinetic calculation that clinical pharmacists often make when giving antibiotics to a hospital patient.  \n",

    "Vancomycin is a common antibiotic that is administered intravenously to target bacterial infections in the body.  Pharmacists will track the concentration of Vancomycin in blood plasma over time to make sure that the right concentration is achieved.  If too little concentration is observed, then the drug may not be effective.  If the concentration is too high, then you can run the risk of kidney injury from high toxicity.  Pharmacists use the area under the concentration\\-time curve to make sure that the concentration is not too low or too high.  This procedure is used so often that this is abbreviated as the _AUC_, and pharmacists almost always use a trapezoidal approximation.\n",
