    "The code below uses the Gompertz growth model, which is sometimes used to model the growth of tumors.  The growth of cells is simulated using techniques from modelling general population growth.  The given parameters represent the initial size of the tumor \\(initial density of the cells\\), the limiting size of the cell density, and the initial rate of tumor growth.  Cancer cells frequently growth in a similar fashion as real\\-life populations, which tend to have a very fast initial growth rate and then plateau \\(stabilize\\) as the population grows. Based on the initial size of the tumor, we can simulate how large we expect a tumor to grow.  The code below is an example of how to solve for the zeros of the Gompertz growth model.  You do not need to memorize this model, we are just using it as an applied example.\n",

    "Richard Levins introduced a way to study _metapopulations_ to see the health of the overall population.  A metapopulation is a collection of subpopulations.   Each subpopulation occupies a single patch, and even though a subpopulation may die, the same patch may be repopulated later by migration of a nearby subpopulation.  (You can see his original paper here: http://campus.lakeforest.edu/menke/PDFs/Bio373/Levins_1969_BulEntSocA.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "We let $P$ denote the proportion of patches that are occupied (so $0 \\leq P \\leq 1)$, $c$ be the colonization rate, and $m$ the mortality rate.  Then the differential equation governing the Levins model is $$P'=cP(1-P) -mP.$$  Below we will study two main cases: 1) If the mortality rate of mosquitoes is larger than the colonization rate, and 2) if the colonization rate is larger than the mortality rate.\n",

Use a command to solve this differential equation for the equilibrium value.\n",
